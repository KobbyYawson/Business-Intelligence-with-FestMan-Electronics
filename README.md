FestMan Electronics Power BI Dashboard Project

Project Overview
This project involved analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by FestMan Electronics, containing information about Sales, Customers, Products, and Stores. The primary goal was to uncover actionable insights and present them in a user-friendly Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations, filters, and drill-down capabilities. 

Key Areas of Analysis:
1. Sales Performance Analysis
   - Evaluated global sales performance by Product Category, Subcategory, Brand, and Country.
   - Identified Top-selling products, Best-performing Stores, and High-revenue Customer Segments.
   - Analyzed Seasonal Trends in order volume and revenue.
   - Calculated the Average Delivery Time and observed trends over time.
   - Investigated differences in Average Order Value (AOV) between Online and In-store Sales.

2. Customer Segmentation and Profiling
   - Segmented customers based on Demographics (age, gender, location), Purchase Behavior**, and Product Preferences**.

3. Product Portfolio Optimization
   - Evaluated product performance in terms of Sales and Profitability.
   - Identified Underperforming or Overstocked Products for potential discounts or discontinuation.

4. Global Market Analysis
   - Assessed sales performance and Market Share across Countries and Continents.
   - Investigated the impact of Exchange Rates on sales and profitability.
   - Highlighted Emerging Markets for growth opportunities and targeted marketing.
